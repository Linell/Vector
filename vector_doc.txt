Introduction
	Vector classes that I was able to find in python online were generally either lacking functionality or simply too complicated. I decided that the simplest way to remedy this situation was to make one myself. With the basic structure, mostly the metaclass, from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2401185/python-vector-class I was able to make a class to meet all of my needs. I am adding functionality as it is needed. If you would like to see something added or find a bug, please send me an email and I will work on it.

Information
	Declared as simply Vector(x,y,z). The (x,y,z) values are automatically converted to floating point numbers. Here is a list of included operators and what they do:
Operator                    Function
_________________________________________________
   +              Adds the vectors (self, other)
   -              Subtracts the vectors (self,other)
   ~              Returns the magnitude (self)
   *              Returns the dot product (self, other)
   **             Returns the cross product

Function                     Result
__________________________________________________
 proj(u,v)        Returns the projection of u on to v.
                  In the form of a vector.
 comp(u,v)        Returns the scalar projection as a 
                  floating point value.


To Do
	Needs more error handling.
